1. **Tokenization**: The script uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to perform word tokenization on file content. This could be used to process text data for NLP tasks.

2. **File Encoding**: The function `read_with_different_encodings(file_path)` tries to read a file with different encodings. If it fails to read the file with any of the given encodings, it raises an exception.

3. **Directory Mapping**: `create_directory_map(path, prefix="")` and `create_directory_map(folder_path)` functions seem to be creating a map of directories. The first one prints out the directory structure recursively, while the second one creates a replica of the provided directory and calculates the size and token count for each file.

4. **File Summary Extraction**: The function `extract_summary(file_path)` extracts a summary from the Python script by reading the first three sentences.

5. **Info Extraction**: `extract_info(file_path, pattern)` extracts information from a Python script using a specified regular expression pattern.

6. **Module Import**: `import_module_from_file(file_path)` imports a Python module from a file using its file path.

7. **Relative Path Extraction**: `get_relative_path(path, base_path)` gets the relative path of a file or directory from a base directory.

8. **File Filtering**: `get_files_in_directory(directory)` and `get_filtered_files(directory)` get a list of files in a directory and filtered files in a directory respectively. Filtered files exclude files like `__pycache__`, `main.py`, `__init__.py` and directories like `__pycache__`.

9. **Main Function Creation**: `create_main(module_name)` creates a main function that excludes certain files and directories and prints a message containing the module name. 

Please note that you provided two functions with the same name `create_directory_map` which is not a good practice in Python. It might lead to unexpected behavior as the second definition will overwrite the first one.
